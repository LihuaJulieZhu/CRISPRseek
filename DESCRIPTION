Description: The package includes functions to find potential spacers for input sequences, optionally filter spacers without restriction enzyme cut site, or without paired spacers, genome-wide search for off-targets, score, rank, fetch flank sequence and indicate whether the spacers and off-targets are located in exon region or not. Potential spacers are annotated with total score of the top5 and topN off-targets, detailed topN mismatch sites, restriction enzyme cut sites, and paired spacers. This package leverages Biostrings and BSgenome packages.
