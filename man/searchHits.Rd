\title{Search for off targets in a sequence as DNAString}
\usage{
searchHits(
  gRNAs,
  seqs,
  seqname,
  max.mismatch = 3,
  PAM.size = 3,
  gRNA.size = 20,
  PAM = "NGG",
  PAM.pattern = "NNN$",
  allowed.mismatch.PAM = 2,
  PAM.location = "3prime",
  outfile,
  baseEditing = FALSE,
  targetBase = "C",
  editingWindow = 4:8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gRNAs}{DNAStringSet object containing a set of gRNAs. Please note the
sequences must contain PAM appended after gRNAs, e.g.,
ATCGAAATTCGAGCCAATCCCGG where ATCGAAATTCGAGCCAATCC is the gRNA and CGG is
the PAM}

\item{seqs}{DNAString object containing a DNA sequence.}

\item{seqname}{Specify the name of the sequence}

\item{max.mismatch}{Maximum mismatch allowed in off target search, default
3. Warning: will be considerably slower if it is set to greater than 3}

\item{PAM.size}{Size of PAM, default 3}

\item{gRNA.size}{Size of gRNA, default 20}

\item{PAM}{PAM as regular expression for appending to the gRNA, default NGG
for SpCas9, change to TTTN for cpf1.}

\item{PAM.pattern}{Regular expression of PAM, default N[A|G]G$ for spCas9.
For cpf1, ^TTTN since it is a 5 prime PAM sequence}

\item{allowed.mismatch.PAM}{Maximum number of mismatches allowed in the
offtargets comparing to the PAM sequence. Default to 2 for NGG PAM}

\item{PAM.location}{PAM location relative to gRNA. For example, spCas9 PAM
is located on the 3 prime while cpf1 PAM is located on the 5 prime}

\item{outfile}{File path to temporarily store the search results}

\item{baseEditing}{Indicate whether to design gRNAs for base editing.
Default to FALSE If TRUE, please set baseEditing = TRUE, targetBase and
editingWidow accordingly.}

\item{targetBase}{Applicable only when baseEditing is set to TRUE. It is
used to indicate the target base for base editing systems, default to C for
converting C to T in the CBE system. Please change it to A if you intend to
use the ABE system.}

\item{editingWindow}{Applicable only when baseEditing is set to TRUE. It is
used to indicate the effective editing window to consider for the offtargets
search only, default to 4 to 8 which is for the original CBE system. Please
change it accordingly if the system you use have a different editing window,
or you would like to include offtargets with the target base in a larger
editing window.}
}
\value{
a data frame contains 
\itemize{
\item{IsMismatch.posX} - {indicator variable indicating
whether this position X is mismatch or not, (1 means yes and 0 means not). X takes on values from 1 to gRNA.size, representing all positions in the guide RNA (gRNA). }
\item{strand} - {strand of
the match, + for plus and - for minus strand}
\item{chrom} - {chromosome of the off
target}
\item{chromStart} - {start position of the off target}
\item{chromEnd} - {end
position of the off target}
\item{name} - {gRNA name}
\item{gRNAPlusPAM} - {gRNA sequence
with PAM sequence concatenated}
\item{OffTargetSequence} - {the genomic sequence of
the off target}
\item{n.mismatch} - {number of mismatches between the off target and
the gRNA}
\item{forViewInUCSC} - {string for viewing in UCSC genome browser, e.g.,
chr14:31665685-31665707}
\item{score} - {set to 100, and will be updated in
getOfftargetScore}
