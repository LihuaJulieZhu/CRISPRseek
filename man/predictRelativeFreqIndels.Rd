\title{Predict insertions and deletions induced by CRISPR/Cas9 editing}
\usage{
predictRelativeFreqIndels(extendedSequence, method = "Lindel")
}
\arguments{
\item{extendedSequence}{A vector of DNA sequences of length 60bp. It consists 30bp before the cut site
and 30bp after the cut site.}

\item{method}{the prediction method. default to Lindel. Currently only Lindel method are implemented.}
}
\value{
A list with the same length as the input extendedSequence. 

Each list item either contains a data frame with three columns or a warning message.

The three columns are the alignment of predicted indel sequence to the original unedited sequence,
predicted indel frequency, and the location of the predicted indels.
The warning message for Lindel method is as follows.

Warning: No PAM sequence is identified. Please check your sequence and try again.

\description{
Predict insertions and deletions, and associated reletive frequecies induced by CRISPR/Cas9 editing
}
\details{
Predict relative indel frequency around target sites of CRISPR/Cas9 system.
Currently only Lindel method using logistic regression is implemented in CRISPRseek.

Lindel is compatible with both Python2.7 and Python3.5 or higher.

By default, reticulate uses the version of Python found on your PATH (i.e. Sys.which("python")).

Use the function use_python in reticulate library to set the python path to a specific version.
For example, use_python('/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7')

\code{}. This function implements the Lindel method
