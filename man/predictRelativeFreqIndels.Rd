\title{Predict insertions and deletions induced by CRISPR/Cas9 editing}
\usage{
predictRelativeFreqIndels(extendedSequence, method = "Lindel")
}
\arguments{
\item{extendedSequence}{A vector of DNA sequences of length 60bp. It consists 30bp before the cut site
and 30bp after the cut site.}

\item{method}{the prediction method. default to Lindel. Currently only Lindel method are implemented.}
}
\value{
A list with the same length as the input extendedSequence. 

Each list item either contains a data frame with three columns or a warning message.

The three columns are the alignment of predicted indel sequence to the original unedited sequence,
predicted indel frequency, and the location of the predicted indels.
The warning message for Lindel method is as follows.

Warning: No PAM sequence is identified. Please check your sequence and try again.

\description{
Predict insertions and deletions, and associated reletive frequecies induced by CRISPR/Cas9 editing
}
\details{
Predict relative indel frequency around target sites of CRISPR/Cas9 system.
Currently only Lindel method using logistic regression is implemented in CRISPRseek.
Need to download and install the python package Lindel first.

git clone https://github.com/shendurelab/Lindel.git 

cd Lindel

sudo python setup.py install

Lindel is compatible with both Python2.7 and Python3.5 or higher.

By default, reticulate uses the version of Python found on your PATH (i.e. Sys.which("python")).

Set the python path in R to the output of sys.path (import sys first) in python where Lindel has been setup.
For example, use_python('/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7')

You can also suggest a Conda env to use.

For example, use_condaenv("r-cl", conda = "/opt/anaconda3/condabin/conda")

\code{}This function implements the Lindel method
