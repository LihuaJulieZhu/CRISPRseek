CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------
NEW FEATURE
     o Search for off-targets is much faster when more than 10 gRNAs are searched 
     o Added new optional parameter orgAnn in offTargetAnalysis 
     o Added gene ID and optional gene symbol in off-target output file 
     o Added gRNA target region, GC content of gRNA and number of Ts in the last 4 postion of gRNA (not including PAM sequence) in the summary output file

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.5
------------------------
BUG FIX
     o TopN offtarget total score was sometimes missing for sequences containing gRNAs with less than 6 offtargets in version 1.3.3 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.7
------------------------
NEW FEATURE
     o Added searchDirection to compare2Sequences to allow search one against the other and many to many sequence search
     o Added exception handling to catch no gRNA found error in compare2Sequences

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.8
------------------------
NEW FEATURE
     o Added calculategRNAefficiency to calculate gRNA cleavage efficiency using DoenchNBT2014 predictive logistic model

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.10
------------------------
NEW FEATURE
     o gRNAs are automatically output to a bed file for view in the UCSC genome browser
